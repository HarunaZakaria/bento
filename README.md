## Overview
This is is a project that I am working on in order to polish my frontend skills. as a web developer there is the need to have a relevant knowlede in writing plain HTML and CSS and for that reason I choose to do some projects in frontend mentor, so this project is one of the many projects that I will be doing from frontend mentor.

This project is a Bend to Grid that I have to build using only HTML and CSS. In building this project I have to consider the mobile width and the desktop width wheich are 375px and 1440px respectively.

The main focus is to make the form responsive for both mobile and desktop views and to do that I will be using the above width for the mobile and the desktop.

### The challenge
working on this particular project has exposed me to alot of challenges and gave me an opportunity to solved those challenges. I had to first think of how to make the boxese adapt to different screen sizes based on the
measuremeent I was given and befoer I could do that I had to learn media queries in order to implement that functionality of the boxese adapting to different screen sizes.

## My process
To build this project, I started by first writing out the plain HTML and format it very well taking into account the class names before I could 
start the CSS part. 
Eventhough I wrote the HTML first but when I was working on the CSS part, there was a time that I had to come back to the HTML and add some new classes just to enable me style them them way I really want and doing so made it very easy for me to design the form without much challenges.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During the whole time I spend doing the project, I have learned that writing more code is really the best way to master programming and When I was working oon the project, it got to some point that I felt I should stop again. That is where I realize how much joy writing cod actually gives me. It made me felt like I was actually working on a real life project that is actually under production and all that made me realize how much joy there is in coding.

The whole project was difficult as first but as I ontinue working on it I realize that most of the challenges that I was facing was not that a big deal and I need was to refresh myself and come back again which explain how much important it is to take breaks when I'm coding.

This project has given me the chancce to used my knowledge in HTML and CSS and to solve a problem that seem impossible for me at the beginning
and throught this roject I was able to use my knoledge on how to target some specific HTML element directly in the CSS and also how to target a specific class and give it the behavior I wanted it to have.

Through this project, I also gained some knowledge to add to my tool of knolewdge and will use those knoledge in my next projects. Among the new knowledge that I got from this project was making the Bend to Grid responsive to both mobile and desktop devices, although the actual width for both the mobile and the desktop was given to me I was able to used media query to be able to make the form adapt to any of the width that was given to me.


### Continued development

In my next projects< i am going to focus more on the flexbox and gird in order to build any project that I can think of, I want to master frontend in such a way that building any real life project won't be hard for me or passing an interview will be any difficult thing for me.
